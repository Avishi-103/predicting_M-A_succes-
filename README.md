# predicting_M-A_succes-

This project focuses on analyzing the impact of media sentiment on the success of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) deals in the finance domain. Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly logistic regression, the project aims to predict the outcomes of M&A transactions based on sentiment analysis of media coverage.

# Key Features:

Logistic Regression Model: Utilizes logistic regression to predict the success or failure of M&A deals by analyzing media sentiment.

Data Preprocessing: Implements thorough data preprocessing techniques, including one-hot encoding for categorical variables, to prepare the dataset for analysis.

Evaluation Metrics: Evaluates model performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in predicting M&A outcomes.

Classification Report: Generates a comprehensive classification report detailing the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class, providing insights into the model's performance.
